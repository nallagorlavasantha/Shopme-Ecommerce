# Shopme E‑Commerce Application

## About Project
Shopme is a full‑stack e‑commerce application. Having experienced e‑commerce platforms only from a user’s perspective, I wanted to explore what happens behind the scenes. Through building this system, I’ve discovered the many architectural layers involved — from database design and role‑based security to modular development — and I am gradually implementing and refining each component.

## System Architecture
This is a multi‑module project that separates code for back‑end and front‑end applications:

1. **ShopmeCommon** – shared library for both back‑end and front‑end applications  
2. **ShopmeWebParent** – parent module that manages common dependencies  
   - **ShopmeBackend** – back‑end code for roles (Admin, Editor, Salesperson, Assistant, Shipper)  
   - **ShopmeFrontend** – front‑end code and UI components

## Technical Highlights
**Back‑end**
- Java  
- JPA and Hibernate  
- Test classes to perform database actions using `@DataJpaTest`  

**Front‑end**
- HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript  

**Database**
- PostgreSQL  

## Key Actors
The types of users who will interact with the application:

| Role        | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin**   | Manage all aspects of the system, including users, roles, products, and orders   |
| **Editor**  | Manage brands, categories, articles, products, and menus                         |
| **Salesperson** | Manage sales reports, customers, orders, and shipping rates; update product prices |
| **Assistant** | Manage customer questions and product reviews                                  |
| **Shipper** | View products and orders; update order status                                    |
| **Customer** | Browse products and categories; place orders and track delivery; manage profile and payment methods |
| **Visitor** | Register and log in; view products and articles                                  |

## Technical Requirements
- Both front‑end and back‑end applications will be accessible on any device  
- Applications will be available 24/7 after deployment  
- Authentication is required for all users; authorization is assigned by Admin via the control panel  
- Passwords are securely hashed and not stored directly in the database  
- Requests are optimized for performance, with error handling that directs users to informative fallback pages  
- Back‑end and front‑end can be scaled independently  

## Project Status
This is an ongoing project that I am actively developing and updating on a daily basis. The repository reflects my continuous learning journey, where I implement new features, refine the architecture, and explore advanced concepts in full‑stack e‑commerce design.

## Planned Features
- Exporting reports in PDF and Excel formats  
- Secure password hashing and authentication  
- Advanced role‑based access control (Admin, Customer, User)  
- Order management and payment integration  
- Product catalog with categories and inventory tracking  
- Front‑end enhancements for improved user experience  

## Getting Started
Instructions for running the application will be added once configuration files (e.g., `application.properties`) are finalized.
